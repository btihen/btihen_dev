abstract: This year our interests in teaching plant science (Dan), robotics (Bill),
  and ecology-based climate research (John) came together nicely through a combination
  of hard work and collaboration into the creation of a ClimateCase that, with sensors,
  actuators, 3D-printed parts, and micro-controllers, can create ecology-in-a-box,
  including replicating the outside climate inside the classroom.
summary: Through efforts in citizen science, like building a ClimateCase to replicate
  outside conditions, LAS is teaching real science. Teachers also simulated projected
  changes to see if they could assess plant survivability.
