abstract: 'Uplift focuses on the creation of an atmosphere in which students build
  on existing strengths and grow their self-confidence. Students are probably more
  likely to find joy in learning when they start from a position of strength and redirecting
  them away from distracting activities is easier. '
summary: Uplift focuses on the creation of an atmosphere in which students build on
  existing strengths and grow their self-confidence. Dangerous to an atmosphere of
  uplift are traditional assessment practices.
