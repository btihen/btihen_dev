  So what’s agility? You’ll get different answers from different people, but you’ll likely pick up on a strong leitmotif of collaborative work, completed in short iterations, with lots of feedback informing the team and the work along the way.
  There is a document describing the basic elements, written in software terms, called the Agile Manifesto. The document stresses (quoting directly):
  (1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools (2) Working software over comprehensive documentation (3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and (4) Responding to change over following a plan.
summary: So what’s agility? You’ll get different answers from different people, but
  you’ll likely pick up on a strong leitmotif of collaborative work.
