abstract: "Learning needs to change, as much as possible, from an externally driven
  system pushed at students by the curriculum into an internally driven system in
  which work is pulled by students, based on their own needs and interests.\nA curriculum
  is first pushed to us (perhaps by the State, or an adopted off-the-shelf curriculum,
  or the schoolâ€™s administration, or all three), then we push the subjects and the
  content of those subjects to our students. We also push course requirements, assignments,
  grading systems, and due dates. For that matter, we push our viewpoints, directly
  or indirectly.  And all of us, teachers and students, get rated in one form or another
  on how well we helped push the prescribed curriculum. "
summary: Learning needs to change. Ideally schools could adopt a student-pulled curriculum
  (instead of a push system, which is what we overwhelmingly have), based on their
  own needs and interests.
