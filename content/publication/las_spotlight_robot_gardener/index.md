abstract: "An interview with Daniel Patton (science) and Bill Tihen (IT) who joined forces to create a course that includes both their interests—biology and electronics. The basic task for students? Build a terrarium that will support a healthy garden, but make it using simple robotics and coding so that the garden will stay alive even when you aren’t around."
