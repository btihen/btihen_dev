Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to the Ash Framework 2.1!

{{< cta cta_text="Visit Tutorial" cta_link="00_introduction" >}}

## Overview

[Ash Framework](https://ash-hq.org/) is a declarative, resource-oriented application development framework for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). A resource can model anything, like a database table, an external API, or even custom code.

I've been curious about the Elixir Ash Framework and with the current 'stable' release, I decided to spend part of my vacation to explore and hopefully learn Ash.

## Note

It is expected that you are already familiar with Elixir (but you need not be an expert). If you want to learn more about Elixir I recommend both [Dockyard Academy Curriculum](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
