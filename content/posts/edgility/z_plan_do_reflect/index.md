# Reflection and Actions

Or in a more Agile Context: (Plan, Do, Assess, Plan, Do, Assess, ...) loop

One of the absolute most important aspects of Uplifting Eduction and helping students feel good about life-long learning and accepting change and a willingness to adapt as our world evolves is to ensure our students are comfortable (have safe experiences) with changing themselves and their approach (and experiences setbacks in a safe environment).

To do this it is important that the student is bought into the class goals and engaged enough to work to get there.  This of course, is easiest when the students have a large choice in the goal (but still within the class goals).  I generally, let students create a goal for a bigger context, like a company that accomplishes something within the context of the class material -- in this way they have their own story-line and goal to work toward (& I drop away as a teacher and am there as a technical consultant).

Ideally, this would be enough, unfortunately, many students have little practice dealing with difficulties, challenges, messy 'real-life' details without one perfect answer and setbacks.  To that end, I like to ensure all work by students has two competing goals to ensure there is no Googleable perfect answer.  In fact, in a STEAM / engineering context, I like to ensure there are features and fail-safe concerns addressed.

To address the students lack of experience with setbacks and problem solving I have found several things help wildly:

0. Build this into class: with STEAM - I have the kids start wrapping up 5-10 minutes early so they have time to clean up and tell me their retrospective findings and actions before leaving class (I do this by group).  I also check-in with the students and take a tour of the groups for the first 5-10 minutes of class and just ask about their next steps.

1. **Reflection** - It is important to stop and reflect regularly and adjust plans.  Although this seems obvious, it is crazy rare and students seem to have very little practice -- many seem to expect the teacher to provide all the guidance.  And their focus tends to be on being right and efficient - not on learning and improving.  To address this I focus on these things (NOTE - it is very important to include the positive not just the corrections - students get more than enough corrections and many get too little re-enforcements):
  * the students must **verbalize their most important: _success_ and _problem_**
  * identify what **(condition) is creating their progress**
  * identify what **(condition) is creating a current problem or a likely future problem**
  * identify what will help them the most - a plan to increase positive or a plan to navigate around challenges and pick an action plan (see next section).

2. **Action Plans** - as the students leave (after they have identified - as a group their most important reflection), then of course I ask about their Plan.  What will the do next class.  Their next class action plan can be, do more (or less) of something - these usually relate to group dynamics.  It could also be their next small step or a change in design to meet some future developing problem.  They just need an action plan as they leave.  HOWEVER, students generally also need practice with creating actions that will lead toward success.  So I have 3 guidelines for a action plan (it is an experiment, it is a small bet - its ok if it doesn't work, it passes the "live/dead" tests):
  * The action should be an **experiment** for x days/hours we do y action and then re-assess.  This 'test' approach helps students who disagree since in two days (or whatever the test is over and if it is really bad, they can stop).
  * it should be a **little bet** -- it is a small enough experiment (over a short period of time) that its not a problem if it doesn't work.
  * must be a **Action** -- it passes the **live/dead person** test
  - **pass the live person test** - their action plan must be something that a **live person** can actually do -- without super hero powers.  _(small bets - small enough that its not a drama if it doesn't work)_  For example they may choose to say we will start class with a quick refresher of what we decided at the end of last class -- that has worked well for the last two days so we will do more of that.
  - **fail the dead person test** - their action plan must be something that a dean person _cannot_ do!  If a dead person can do that action - then it isn't valid.  For example, a group might say we will fight less.  Good idea, but dead people don't fight either, so they need to reframe it into what they will **do** when they disagree.

**Summary:** it may all sound complex, but if done daily (with a checklist) the students get quite good at this.

Reflection:
- what's helping? & why?
- what's hindering? & why?
- what's the most important of these two?

Action:
- is an experiment over x days (to accomplish y)
- it is a little bet - no problem if it doesn't work.
- a live person can do it & a dead person cannot!


At first these reflections and actions are likely to be totally new and difficult for kids - guide them in the begging by asking questions.  Most students quick catch on to what is expected -- kids are experts at this.  When they are able to independently reflect on what is helpful and a hinderance and build small 'ACTIONS' time-boxed as experiments.  They are actually learning the essence of Agile - to be **adaptive** and the **plan, do, assess** loop.

In many ways this is the core of Agile and a wonder way to help students become independent life-long learners ready to learn and adapt to our evolving future that none of us can predict.


## Side benefit

This implies genuine respect for the student.

It communicates that:

1. we care and are not here to judge and correct - but to help.  Whenever possible, the criteria for success should be a neutral "world test" - not teacher judgement.  (i.e. when this truck is placed in the center of the student bridge, it doesn't collapse).
2. we offer choice when possible and let students learn the curriculum in the context of their goals and values.
3. we don't expect / accept zombie work (dead/live) test
4. we don't expect / accept work that has been done 1,000 times and can be found on Google (that's also a type of meaningless work that leads to zombie actions).  The work should be complex and have competing needs that requires thought and judgement to find a satisfactory solution in line with their chosen goal(s).

Of course for some this may be a bit new and take some practice since it is simpler to know that their is a simple right answer and as a student you are good or not at the subject and the student is just there for the ride and the teacher provides everything else.
