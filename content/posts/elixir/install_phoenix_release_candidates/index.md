I had vacation and Phoenix 1.7 wasn't yet released and I wanted to try it out.  I discovered its simple to install without a hex package.

## Install Phoenix Release Candidate

First I let's install the unreleased version of [Phoenix 1.7 RC](
https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/phoenix-1.7-released) - **Note** For the rc period, youâ€™ll need to explicitly install the phx.new generator from hex to try out a fresh project:

```bash
mix archive.uninstall phx_new
mix archive.install hex phx_new helpdesk
cd helpdesk
mix ecto.create
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial phoenix commit"
iex -S mix phx.server
```

Now we have a fully functional Phoenix site - with the new Phoenix Tailwind CSS design.
